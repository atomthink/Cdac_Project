# Fullstack Gym

This repo contains the code for the Fullstack Gym app built for our university course.

# About the project
This is a fullstack project that includes a website, an android app and an API. 

The website is used as a promotional tool for the gym and also as the main interface for the gym's admin (the user that manages the gym's data).

The android app is used by the users to register for the gym classes provided by their subscription.

The API is used for both the website and the android app to communicate with the database.
